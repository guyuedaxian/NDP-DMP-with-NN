## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards Robot Skill Learning by Exploiting Imitation Learning
> This repository is for my MSc Project with the degree of MSc Advanced Computer Science(AI).
----
The aim of this project is to investigate and reproduce an imitation learning approach called 
Neural Dynamic Policies(NDPs) proposed by Bahl et al.(2020), which can be found at https://shikharbahl.github.io/neural-dynamic-policies/. 
Meanwhile, we also employ another approach similar to NDPs called Deep Encoder-Decoder Networks proposed by Pahiƒç et al.(2018). Subsequently, 
we improve and build several neural network models and variants based on these two approaches, namely DNN-DMP, CNN-DMP, DNN-NDP, SCNN-NDP, 
and CNN-NDP. Then, we train, test, and evaluate these models on a variety of datasets. Finally, we carry on some experiments on a robotic arm to apply NDPs.

## Architectures <a name="architectures"></a>

**The network architecture of NDPs**
> Given an image of the digit as the input of the deep neural network, the output of deep neural work is the initial DMP 
parameters as the input of a Neural Dynamic Policy (NDP), and NDP will generate parameters w (weights of radial-basis functions) and g (goal for the robot). The parameters of the DMP are then predicted as outputs of the preceding layers in the architecture conditioned on the input. Finally, the 
deep neural network output the motion trajectories using these trained DMPs parameters as the last layer of the deep neural network.

**The network architecture of Deep Encoder-Decoder Neural Networks**
> This architecture describes the process of training DMPs parameters and generating writing 
trajectories of digits. In the first step, each input image is fed to the deep encoder-decoder network that transforms the input image into DMPs parameters, which are compared to raw DMPs parameters associated with the input image. Then, the loss function and its gradients are computed to optimize the parameters of the deep encoder-decoder networks bythe backpropagation algorithm. A deep encoder-decoder model will be trained after the first step. Finally, the DMPs parameters k predicted by the trained model are used to generate the desired writing trajectories associated with this input image by integrating with the DMP approach.
