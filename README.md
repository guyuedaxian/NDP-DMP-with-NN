In this project, we use some open souce code. The source code of NDPs approach (Neural Dynamic Policies for End-to-End Sensorimotor Learning) is from: https://github.com/shikharbahl/neural-dynamic-policies/. We also use source code of the Deep Encoder-Decoder Networks approach, which comes from: https://github.com/abr-ijs/imednet. Also, some third-party source code comes from: https://github.com/abr-ijs/digit_generator.
