### Datasets
In this project, we use five types of datasets to train, test and evaluate our models. they are show as following:
- MNIST dataset: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
- Noisy MNIST (n-MNIST) dataset: https://csc.lsu.edu/~saikat/n-mnist/
- Synthetic MNIST (s-MNIST) dataset: https://portal.ijs.si/nextcloud/s/mnp2DD7qCYzyPd5
- Multi-digit MNIST (m-MNIST) dataset: https://github.com/shaohua0116/MultiDigitMNIST
- EMNIST (e-MNIST) dataset: https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset

In this project, we use some open souce code. The source code of NDPs approach (Neural Dynamic Policies for End-to-End Sensorimotor Learning) is from: https://github.com/shikharbahl/neural-dynamic-policies/. We also use source code of the Deep Encoder-Decoder Networks approach, which comes from: https://github.com/abr-ijs/imednet. Also, some third-party source code comes from: https://github.com/abr-ijs/digit_generator.
